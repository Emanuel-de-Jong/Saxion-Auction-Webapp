# Auction Webapp
For the class: 2.1 Webtechnology

A simple webapp to bid on products. Features include:
- Account system
- User roles
- CMS

What makes this product special is that it uses some frameworks/libraries that I don't use in my other repositories. Both the frontend and the backend use NodeJS. The backend uses Express and can be accessed using a REST API. The frontend styles the pages using Svelte and is "build" using Rollup. Authentication is done using JWT.
